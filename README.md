## Overview

This project is a learning exercise in implementing **Machine Learning Algorithms** from the ground up. Unlike traditional implementations that rely on preset libraries or functions, this project focuses on building all ML models using core-level logic and algorithms. The primary goal is to deepen understanding of the mathematical foundations and mechanics behind the approach, while applying it to the various datasets.

By constructing the model from scratch, we gain valuable insights into how algorithms work, including the process of calculating coefficients, making predictions, and evaluating model performance. This project serves as an educational resource for those interested in machine learning and statistical modeling.
